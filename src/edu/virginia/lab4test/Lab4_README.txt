CS 4730 Lab 4 README

LabFourGame.java demonstrates a basic implementation of the observer design pattern. The only functionality provided in the demo is a basic quest, where the player needs to pick up the coin on the screen. When the player successfully reaches the coin, an event is thrown that disables the coins visiblity, and updates the UI.
